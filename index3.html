            <h2>The time when Godel was wrong.</h2>
            <p>Using his method, universe of contructibility, in which one may omit all arbitrary
            mathematical objects in order to create a consistent mathematical model to answer certain questions
            of solvability, <span style="color:blue">Godel</span> demonstrated how the Continuum Hypothesis is orthogonal to
            his incompleteness theorems. However, <span style="color:blue">Cohen</span> later came about and used his same method to
            demonstrate that the Continuum hypothesis may also be wrong. This led to the conclusion that our
            current mathematical tools are not sufficient. <span style="color:blue">Godel</span> blamed his shortcomings on his illness later in
            1972.

            <h2>The time when Hilbert was wrong.</h2>
            <p><span style="color:blue">Hilbert</span> asked whether the question of there being an infinite number of points on a line
            to be possible to prove. It is either possible that there infinite number of points on a line
            or lines are self-containing and do not have the same infinity as the real (whole) and rational
            numbers. The question may have been a bad one, as it had been shown to better ask whether there
            are an infinite number of subsets on a line, rather than points, which makes the Continuum Hypothesis
            potentially more tractable.

            <h2>The time when Newton was wrong.</h2>
            <p>
            <span style="color:blue">Newton</span> formalized the physical realm that we easily intuit with great precision, however
            it was soon found that what we find intuitive does not hold at scaled larger of what we observe
            with the naked eye. The notion of "physical" orginated from the Newtonian worldview, and even <span style="color:blue">Newton</span>
            admittedly called gravitation, a force much larger for what we can observe, to have an occult property
            instilled by God. The question of what the clear definition of "physical" is has been discussed
            and will be discussed at great length for years to come.

            <h2>The time when Frege was wrong</h2>
            <p><span style="color:blue">Frege</span> defined a set as the collection of elements for which the element cannot be a
            member of itself. <span style="color:blue">Russell</span> later observed that this would lead to a contradiction and
            formulated his vicious circularity principles. If a set of all barbers cut their client's
            hair, there must exist a barber for which has to cut his own hair. Therefore this would lead to the
            contradiction that there must both be elements in a set describing this totality and also not.
            The conflict arrives when we attempt to describe it, we refer to the elements and not the totality
            itself. <span style="color:blue">Godel</span> showed how this simply means this applies in the realm of constructible
            mathematics, and not mathematics as it exists in the ontological realm.
